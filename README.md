### This is a **full stack** inventory management application using these technologies

- Node.js with Express on the server
- MongoDB as the database
- Mongoose for ORM
- Bootstrap for front-end styling
- Pug/Jade as the templating engine

The app is built with the MVC design pattern using modals, views, and controllers to create the user interface.
